# ImageToTextToFile
Little Ionic App. You can take or upload a Picture und scan the Text of the Image. I used OCR Ionic for Mobile. Then you can safe to Text to SQLite Db.
## Intro:
### what you get:

### Needed:
```
Node, Ionic, Cordova
```
There a a lot of helps to Setup Ionic. Sometimes you have to read carfull the terminal.  
If you got Problems on this, you can just ask.
Then you need to Add Android Plattform. For more Details, check the Ionic API.
### run:
I think you need to install a lot of libs, I dunno If there is a automatik for this.

But then you can't access Cordova libs
For Android:
```
ionic cordova run android
```
It is also posible to use VSC to Debug. Check the Cordova VSC Extension. You need some system Variables.
You can use:
```
"ionicLiveReload": true
```
in your launch.json for liveReloading, so you dont need restart the Debugger everytime you make a change.
