# ImageToTextToFile
Little Ionic App. You can take or upload a Picture und scan the Text of the Image. I used OCR Ionic for Mobile and Tesseract for Desktop. Then you can safe to Text to SQLite Db.
## Intro:
### what you get:

### Needed:
```
Node, Ionic, Cordova, Android Studio (if you want to Build on Android)
```
There a a lot of helps to Setup Ionic. Sometimes you have to read carfull the terminal.  
If you got Problems on this, you can just ask.

I think you need to install a lot of libs, I dunno If there is a automatik for this.
You can ran in Browser
```
ionic cordova run browser
```
Its also possible to use:
```
ionic serve

But then you can't access Cordova libs
For Android:
